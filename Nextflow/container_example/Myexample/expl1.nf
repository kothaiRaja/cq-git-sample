//--split-3:
//The --split-3 option is used to handle paired-end sequencing data.
//Paired-end reads are typically stored in a single SRA file, but when converting to FASTQ, you need to split the forward and reverse reads into separate FASTQ files.
//--split-3 does the following:
//Forward reads are written to a file ending in _1.fastq.
//Reverse reads are written to a file ending in _2.fastq.
//Unpaired reads (reads that donâ€™t have a mate) are written to a separate file ending in .fastq.
